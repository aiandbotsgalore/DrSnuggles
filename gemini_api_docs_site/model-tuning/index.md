# Fine-tuning with the Gemini API

With the deprecation of Gemini 1.5 Flash-001 in May 2025, we no longer have a model available which supports fine-tuning in the Gemini API, but it is supported in [Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/models/gemini-use-supervised-tuning).

We plan to bring fine-tuning support back in the future. We would love to [hear from you on our developer forum](https://discuss.ai.google.dev/c/gemini-api/4) if fine-tuning is important to your use case.
