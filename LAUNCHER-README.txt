   DR. SNUGGLES - QUICK LAUNCH GUIDE
========================================

TWO WAYS TO LAUNCH:

1. DEVELOPMENT MODE (Recommended for daily use)
   File: START-DRSNUGGLES.bat
   - Just double-click to launch
   - Hot reload enabled
   - Shows all debug info
   - Slower startup but easier for testing

2. PRODUCTION MODE (Faster, but requires build)
   File: START-DRSNUGGLES-PROD.bat
   - Faster startup
   - Optimized performance
   - Auto-builds if needed

========================================
WHICH ONE SHOULD I USE?
========================================

Use START-DRSNUGGLES.bat for normal use.

Use START-DRSNUGGLES-PROD.bat if you want
faster startup and don't need to make changes.

========================================
TIPS:
========================================

- You can drag either .bat file to your Desktop for easy access
- Right-click the .bat file → "Pin to Start" for Start Menu access
- Make sure your .env.local file is set up with your API key
- Close the black command window to stop the app
